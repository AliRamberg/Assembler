# Assembler
Pseudo assembly language assembler

## Introduction
This repository is the final project of my C class course in the Open University of Israel
The project is merely the translator part of the whole Assembler software.

## The Machine
The CPU has 8 registers, each is of size of 14 bits.
registers: r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7.
It supports 16 types of opcodes:
    - mov  
    - cmp  
    - add  
    - sub  
    - not  
    - clr  
    - lea  
    - inc  
    - dec  
    - jmp  
    - bne  
    - red  
    - prn  
    - jsr  
    - rts  
    - stop  
There are 4096 memory cells of 14 bits each.
It supports only ascii characters and whole numbers, real numbers throws an error.

###### Note
The project is intended to work with ansi standard compiler
